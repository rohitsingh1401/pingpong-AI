# pingpong-AI

##Overview
it's a  game of [Pong](http://www.ponggame.org)  made from scratch after building a [Deep Q Network](https://www.quora.com/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-how-deep-Q-networks-DQN-work) which gets better over time through trial and error. The DQN is a convolutional neural network that reads in pixel data from the game and the game score. Using just those 2 parameters, it learns what moves it needs to make to become better.

##Installation


* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org)
* cv2 (http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/)
* numpy
* random
* collections
* pygame

use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install the dependencies. Tensorflow and cv2 are more manual. Links provided above ^

##Usage 

Run it in the terminal. it will take time to learn by hit and trials so the more you let it run the more efficient it becomes after sometime.



##Credits

This code was by [malreddysid](https://github.com/malreddysid) i've just summarised and updated  it. it's a very cool thing to do .
